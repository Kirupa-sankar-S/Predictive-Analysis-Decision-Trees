# Predictive Analysis with Decision Trees

## Project Overview
This project uses Decision Trees to predict smoker status based on the Insurance dataset. It demonstrates Classification and Regression techniques, including Gini Index, Entropy, and Pruning.

## Key Features
- **Classification:** Comparing Gini vs Entropy.
- **Optimization:** Pre-pruning (max_depth) and Post-pruning (CCP Alpha).
- **Visualization:** Tree diagrams and Feature Importance charts.

## How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Upload `insurance.csv` to the session storage.
3. Run all cells.
